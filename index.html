        <p>I worked with Nicolas for a short time as a consultant within uLab Systems billing system, and in that time
            Nicolas was a great employee within the company and a great coworker. I started consulting with Nicolas in
            May of 2021 and I was inexperienced because I had just graduated from college. Nicolas immediately helped me
            through the onboarding process to be successful within my role with uLab Systems. He also helped me get
            integrated with different departments and his title, while I worked there, was a solution architect/systems
            integration engineer, he did much more than that.</p>

        <p>In the four months I spent working with Nicolas, there wasn't a day that went by where he wasn't able to
            answer any of my programming questions. Whatever kind of project we were assigned, he would work endlessly
            to provide uLab Systems with the product they were asking us to build. Nicolas, while working as a solutions
            architect/systems integration engineer, was spread out throughout the company and was able to provide
            feedback and support to multiple departments. For instance, Nicolas was able to respond to uLab Systems
            Salesforce team about an API we were using and how to get it to integrate seamlessly for a database we were
            working on. This is just one example of Nicolas's many traits while I was working with him. And during that
            time I was incredibly impressed.</p>

        <p>I could go on commending Nicolas for his role as a consultant with uLab Systems because he made work so much
            easier and had a great attitude every day. He was consistent within his role, offered guidance, provided
            quality code, and had immense knowledge of programming. I'm grateful I was able to work with him and I'm
            even more grateful I can call him a friend.</p>
